# Developing an AI application  - Flower Recognition

In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.

When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset. For example, imagine an app where you take a picture of a car, it tells you what the make and model is, then looks up information about it. Go build your own dataset and make something new.


### Specifications

The project submission must include at least two files `train.py` and `predict.py`.  
The first file, `train.py`, will train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint.  
The second file, `predict.py`, uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image. Feel free to create as many other files as you need.
