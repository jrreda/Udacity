# Deep Learning with PyTorch

Let's put all the pieces together: Python, NumPy/pandas/Matplotlib, Linear Algebra and Neural Networks, and learn [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/).

**[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)** was released in early 2017 and has been making a pretty big impact in the deep learning community. It's developed as an open source project by the [Facebook AI Research team](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/), but is being adopted by teams everywhere in industry and academia.


* **Part 1:** Introduction to PyTorch and using tensors
* **Part 2:** Building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch
* **Part 3:** How to train a fully-connected network with backpropagation on MNIST
* **Part 4:** Exercise - train a neural network on Fashion-MNIST
* **Part 5:** Using a trained network for making predictions and validating networks
* **Part 6:** How to save and load trained models
* **Part 7:** Load image data with torchvision, also data augmentation
* **Part 8:** Use transfer learning to train a state-of-the-art image classifier for dogs and cats
