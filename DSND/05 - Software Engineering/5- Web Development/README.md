# Web Development

In this course, you are going to use Flask to build a data dashboard. You might be thinking that you already have good tools for visualizing data such as matplotlib, seaborn, or Tableau.  

However, the web development skills you'll learn in this lesson will prepare you for building other types of data science applications. Data scientists are increasingly being asked to deploy their work as an application in the cloud.  

For example, consider a project where you build a model that classifies disaster relief messages into categories. With your web development skills, you could turn that model into a web app where you would input a message and display the resulting message category.  

As another example, consider a system that recommends movies based on a user's preferences. Part of the recommendation engine could include a web application that displays recommended products based on a user-id. What you learn in this course will set you up for building the web app portion of the recommendation engine.  

To work with the web template and make a data dashboard, you will only need to write Python code. If you want to customize the dashboard, you can do so with just a few changes to the html code. But the underlying technologies of data dashboard will be css, html, JavaScript, and Python.
