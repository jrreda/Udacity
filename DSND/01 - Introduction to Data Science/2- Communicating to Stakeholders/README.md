# Communicating to Stakeholders

Let's take a look at some of the qualities of good **README** files. In the last video, you saw that a good README should have:

1. **Installation** - Extra libraries that are not installed with the Anaconda distribution, as well as what version of python you are using should be noted.
2. **Project Motivation** - Discuss what your project is about, and what interested you in pursuing the project.
3. **File Descriptions** - Guide others through the files in your repository. You may not talk about every file here, but you should let them know where they can find the work they might find most interesting.
4. **How To Interact With Your Project** - When your project isn't meant to be interactive or used for other projects, you should instead talk about the technical details of your project. What were your results? What did you do to improve them? What methods did you try? What worked? What didn't work?
5. **Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements** - You always want to give credit where necessary. Acknowledge other contributors, helpful peers, data providers, etc.

## Best Practices:

In general, everyone has their own style. However, there are still some best practices that can be followed.

- Know Your Audience.
- Write in small blocks of text, as large blocks of text will exhaust and demotivate your reader. (be short and sweet)
- Create an outline.
- Start with an engaging question or current event that your audience is likely thinking about.
- Steps To Captivate Your Audience:
1. First Catch Their Eye. (Picture First, Title Second)
2. Tries to relate to a problem the reader is facing.
3. End with a recap and a call to action..  (call of action Ex: How will you break into the field?)
- Review. Review. Review. When you think you have reviewed enough, find someone else to review. The more review you have of your work, the better it will become.
