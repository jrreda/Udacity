In this lesson, We learned:


    1. How to use your knowledge of bootstrapping and sampling distributions to create a confidence interval for any population parameter.


    2. You learned how to build confidence intervals for the population mean and difference in means, but really the same process can be done for any parameter you are interested in.


    3. You also learned about how to use python built-in functions to build confidence intervals, but that these rely on assumptions like the **Central Limit Theorem**.


    4. You learned about the difference between **statistical significance** and **practical significance**.


    5. Finally, you learned about other language associated with confidence intervals like **margin of error** and **confidence interval width**, and how to correctly interpret your confidence intervals. Remember, confidence intervals are about **parameters** in a population, and not about individual observations.
