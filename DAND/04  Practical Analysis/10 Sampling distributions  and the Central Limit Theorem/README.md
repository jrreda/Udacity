## Sampling Distributions

* **Sampling Distributions** are the distribution of a statistic (any statistic).


* There are two very important mathematical theorems that are related to sampling distributions: **The Law of Large Numbers** and **The Central Limit Theorem**.


* **The Law of Large Numbers** states that as a sample size increases, the sample mean will get closer to the population mean. In general, if our statistic is a "good" estimate of a parameter, it will approach our parameter with larger sample sizes.


* **The Central Limit Theorem** states that with large enough sample sizes our sample mean will follow a normal distribution, but it turns out this is true for more than just the sample mean.



## Bootstrapping

* **Bootstrapping** is a technique where we sample from a group with replacement.


* We can use bootstrapping to simulate the creation of sampling distribution, which you did many times in this lesson.


* By bootstrapping and then calculating repeated values of our statistics, we can gain an understanding of the sampling distribution of our statistics.
