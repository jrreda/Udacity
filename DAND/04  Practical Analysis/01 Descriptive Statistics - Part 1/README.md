## Data Types <a name="dt"></a>

In this video, two data types are introduced: **Quantitative** and **Categorical**.

1. **Quantitative** data takes on numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations (like the number of dogs).
2. **Categorical** are used to label a group or set of items (like dog breeds - Collies, Labs, Poodles, etc.).



### Categorical Ordinal vs. Categorical Nominal

We can divide categorical data further into two types: **Ordinal** and **Nominal**.

- Categorical **Ordinal** data take on a ranked ordering (like a ranked interaction on a scale from `Very Poor` to `Very Good` with the dogs).
- Categorical **Nominal** data do not have an order or ranking (like the breeds of the dog).



### Continuous vs. Discrete

We can think of quantitative data as being either **continuous** or **discrete**.

- **Continuous** data can be split into smaller and smaller units, and still a smaller unit exists. An example of this is the age of the dog - we can measure the units of the age in years, months, days, hours, seconds, but there are still smaller units that could be associated with the age.
- **Discrete** data only takes on countable values. The number of dogs we interact with is an example of a discrete data type.

## Analyzing Quantitative Data <a name="aqd"></a>

There are four main aspects to analyzing Quantitative data.

1. Measures of `Center`
2. Measures of `Spread`
3. The `Shape` of the data.
4. `Outliers`


## Analyzing Categorical Data

Though not discussed in the video, analyzing categorical data has fewer parts to consider. **Categorical** data is analyzed usually be looking at the counts or proportion of individuals that fall into each group.

For example if we were looking at the breeds of the dogs, we would care about how many dogs are of each breed, or what proportion of dogs are of each breed type.
Measures of Center


### There are three measures of center:

- `Mean` - often called the average or the *expected value* in mathematics.
- `Median` - splits our data so that *50%* of our values are lower and *50%* are higher.
- `Mode` - is the most frequently observed value in our dataset.

The Mean

In this video, we focused on the calculation of the mean. The mean is often called the average or the expected value in mathematics. We calculate the mean by adding all of our values together, and dividing by the number of values in our dataset.

The remaining measures of the median and mode will be discussed in detail in the upcoming quizzes and videos.

## Recap <a name="re"></a>

### Variable Types:

We have covered a lot up to this point! We started with identifying data types as either `categorical` or `quantitative`. We then learned, we could identify quantitative variables as either `continuous` or `discrete`. We also found we could identify categorical variables as either `ordinal` or `nominal`.

### Categorical Variables:

When analyzing categorical variables, we commonly just look at the count or percent of a group that falls into each level of a category. For example, if we had two **levels** of a dog category: `lab` and `not lab`. We might say, 32% of the dogs were `lab` (percent), or we might say 32 of the 100 dogs I saw were labs (count).

However, the 4 aspects associated with describing quantitative variables are not used to describe categorical variables.


### Quantitative Variables:

Then we learned there are four main aspects used to describe `quantitative` variables:

- Measures of Center
- Measures of Spread
- Shape of the Distribution
- Outliers

We looked at calculating measures of `Center`:

- Means
- Medians
- Modes

We also looked at calculating measures of `Spread`:

- Range
- Interquartile Range
- Standard Deviation
- Variance
