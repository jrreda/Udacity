This concludes the practical statistics content! Much of what you saw in these last two lessons on Multiple Linear Regression and Logistic Regression begins to move towards more of a **Data Science** view of the world, and beyond what most **Data Analysts** perform on a day to day basis. However, I hope you enjoyed some of the challenges in these two lessons.


this lesson, we looked at Logistic Regression. You learned:  

    * How to use python to perform logistic regression to predict binary response values in both `statsmodels` and `sklearn`.  

    * How to interpret coefficients from logistic regression output in `statsmodels`.  

    * How to assess how well your model is performing using a variety of metrics.  

    * How to assess model fit in python.
