The topics in this lesson included:  

    - You learned how to build a multiple linear regression model in Python, which was actually very similar to what you did in the last lesson on simple linear regression.  

    - You learned how to encode **dummy variables**, and interpret the coefficients attached to each.  

    - You learned about higher order terms, and how this impacts your ability to interpret coefficients.  

    - You learned how to identify what it would mean for an interaction to be needed in a multiple linear regression model, as well as how to identify other higher order terms. But again, these do make interpreting coefficients directly less of a priority, and move your model towards one that, rather, aims to predict better at the expense of interpretation.  

    - You learned about the model assumptions, and we took a closer look at **multicollinearity**. You learned about variance inflation factors, and how multicollinearity impacts the model coefficients and standard errors.
