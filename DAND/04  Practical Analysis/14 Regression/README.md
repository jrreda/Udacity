In this lesson, we learned about simple linear regression. The topics in this lesson included:  

    * Simple linear regression is about building a line that models the relationship between two quantitative variables.  

    * Learning about correlation coefficients. You learned that this is a measure that can inform you about the **strength** and **direction** of a linear relationship.  

    * The most common way to visualize simple linear regression is using a scatterplot.  

    * A line is defined by an intercept and slope, which you found using the **`statsmodels`** library in Python.  

    * You learned the interpretations for the *slope*, *intercept*, and *R-squared* values.
