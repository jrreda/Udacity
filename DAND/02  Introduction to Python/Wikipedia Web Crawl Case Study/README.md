# Automating the Wikipedia Crawl

Whilst it's interesting to click through Wikipedia, it takes a lot of time to click through and read all those articles. We're going to work on automating this process, ending up with a program that will go through Wikipedia for us, keeping track of the first links on each page and seeing where they lead. In order to do this, we'll need to find out about how web pages work and get to know some of the Python tools we can use to interact with the web and web content.
