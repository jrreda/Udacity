# Bike Share Analysis

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. You will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. You will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.



## Getting Started

To complete this project, you will use Jupyter Notebooks through a workspace in the classroom. Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to work with your code interactively while also being able to include descriptive and informative text to build a report. The next few concepts in this lesson will help you get started with understanding notebooks. If you would like to learn more about these tools, or you need some additional help to get started, you can check out Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks in the "Intro to Data Analysis" Core Concept of this course.


## Completing This Project

The Jupyter Notebook in the "Project Notebook" concept has all the information required to submit this project. Click on the `Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb` file to start up the notebook kernel. Read through the notebook, answering questions and running blocks of code when prompted. Remember that if you get stuck or if you have any questions along the way, you can reach out for help using support resources like live help and the Slack community. If you feel comfortable with it, you can also download all of the necessary files, either from the Resources tab on this page or from the "Project Notebook" page, and work on the project using a local installation of Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook.

When you’ve worked through the entire notebook, you will download your work and submit it in the last concept in the lesson. You will submit two files: the original file and a more portable format. For the former, if you go to the front menu of the notebook page (where you can see the project files) and click on the checkbox to the left of the file name, you should see a set of buttons appear at the top of the page. You can click on the "Download" button to download your completed notebook to your local computer. For the latter, you can save a copy of the report as a .html or .pdf document by accessing the "File > Download as…" menu in the Notebook app. This way, someone who wants to just read your completed work can view it without needing to start up the Notebook app themselves.
