In this first case study, you'll perform the entire data analysis process to investigate a dataset on wine quality. Along the way, you'll explore new ways of manipulating data with `NumPy` and `Pandas`, as well as powerful visualization tools with `Matplotlib`.


We're going to investigate this [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) on physicochemical properties and quality ratings of red and white wine samples. Let's take a closer look at its attributes and pose some questions for our analysis!
