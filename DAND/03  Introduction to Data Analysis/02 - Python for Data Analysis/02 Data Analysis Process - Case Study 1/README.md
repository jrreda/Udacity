# Data Analysis Process - Case Study 1

We're going to investigate this [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) on physicochemical properties and quality ratings of red and white wine samples. Let's take a closer look at its attributes and pose some questions for our analysis!



## Wine Quality Data Set from UCI Machine Learning

There are two datasets (`winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv`) that provide information on samples of red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Each sample of wine was rated for quality by wine experts and examined with physicochemical tests. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only data on these physicochemical properties and quality ratings are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

Attributes in Each Dataset:
#### Physicochemical Properties:
1. Fixed Acidity
2. Volatile Acidity
3. Citric Acid
4. Residual Sugar
5. Chlorides
6. Free Sulfur Dioxide
7. Total Sulfur Dioxide
8. Density
9. pH
10. Sulphates
11. Alcohol

#### Quality Rating:
12. Quality - Score between 0 and 10 (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts)
