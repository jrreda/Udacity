# RECAP

Each of the sections has been labeled to assist if you need to revisit a particular topic. Intentionally, the solutions for a particular section are actually not in the labeled section, because my hope is this will force you to practice if you have a question about a particular topic we covered.


You have now gained a ton of useful skills associated with **SQL**. The combination of **JOINs** and **Aggregations** are one of the reasons **SQL** is such a powerful tool.


If there was a particular topic you struggled with, I suggest coming back and revisiting the questions with a fresh mind. The more you practice the better, but you also don't want to get stuck on the same problem for an extended period of time!
