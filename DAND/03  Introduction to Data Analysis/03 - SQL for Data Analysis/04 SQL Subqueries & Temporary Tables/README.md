# SQL Subqueries & Temporary Tables

This lesson was the first of the more advanced sequence in writing SQL. Arguably, the advanced features of **Subqueries** and **CTEs** are the most widely used in an analytics role within a company. Being able to break a problem down into the necessary tables and finding a solution using the resulting table is very useful in practice.

If you didn't get the solutions to these queries on the first pass, don't be afraid to come back another time and give them another try. Additionally, you might try coming up with some questions of your own to see if you can find the solution.

The remaining portions of this course may be key to certain analytics roles, but you have now covered all of the main SQL topics you are likely to use on a day to day basis.
