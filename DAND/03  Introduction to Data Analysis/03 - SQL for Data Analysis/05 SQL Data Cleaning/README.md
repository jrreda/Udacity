# Recap


You now have a number of tools to assist in cleaning messy data in SQL. Manually cleaning data is tedious, but you now can clean data at scale using your new skills.


For a reminder on any of the data cleaning functionality, the concepts in this lesson are labeled according to the functions you learned. If you felt uncomfortable with any of these functions at first, that is normal - these take some getting used to. Don't be afraid to take a second pass through the material to sharpen your skills!


Memorizing all of this functionality isn't necessary, but you do need to be able to follow documentation, and learn from what you have done in solving previous problems to solve new problems.


There are a few other functions that work similarly. You can read more about those [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_isnull.asp). You can also get a walk through of many of the functions you have seen throughout this lesson [here](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/sql-string-functions-for-cleaning/).


Nice job on this section!
