# Become a Data Analyst

Advance your programming skills and refine your ability to work with messy, complex datasets. You’ll learn to manipulate and prepare data for analysis, and create visualizations for data exploration. Finally, you’ll learn to use your data skills to tell a story with data.


## What You Will Learn

1. **Introduction to Data Analysis**

    Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.  
    - Explore Weather Trends  
    - Investigate a Dataset  

2. **Practical Statistics**

    Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.  
    - Analyze Experiment Results

3. **Data Wrangling**

    Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.  
    - Wrangle and Analyze Data  

4. **Data Visualization with Python**

    Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.
