# Create a Tableau Story

For the final project, you will create an explanatory data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, and your final deliverable will be a write up along with a Tableau Public workbook.

We will provide some options of data sets to explore; however, you may choose to explore an entirely different data set. You should be aware that finding your own data set and cleaning it using Python, R, or some other language can take considerable time and effort. This can add as much as a day, a week, or even months to your project so embark on the adventure to find and clean a data set if you are truly prepared with data wrangling skills.


You have three options for this project. You should pick an option based on your prior experience with data munging and exploratory data analysis. The option you choose will not affect the evaluation of the project.

- **Option 1**: Select one of the beginner data sets, which already has a summary of findings, from the Data Set Options document. Then, create a visualization that communicates the findings.
- **Option 2**: Select one of the intermediate data sets from the Data Set Options document. You will investigate the data set to share a story or message about the data and then create a suitable visualization.
- **Option 3**: Find a data set, investigate it, and share your findings in a visualization. Your final graphic should primarily be explanatory, but it may also contain exploratory components. You can find a list of recommended websites to find data sets in the Data Set Options document. You should be aware that finding your own data set, cleaning the data set, and analyzing it (using R, iPython Notebook, or another tool) can take considerable time and effort. This can lengthen the time you spend on your project by days, weeks, or even months. Choose the option only if you feel prepared for a challenge!
